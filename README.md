<h1>Horse Race Simulator</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
  This propgram lets you part-take in a horse race! You are able to customise up to five horses, deciding on their names, symbols representing them in the race, their confidence score, colours, breeds
  and even the lanes they go in! Any and all mistakes will be pointed out to you in regards with entering the data so that you may have the best possible user experience. As well as this, there are
  also features including statistics, where at any point in the race you may chose to see how far and fast a certain horse has traveled, and even a betting system where you may place bets on your favourite horse!
